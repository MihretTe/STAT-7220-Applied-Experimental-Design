        "**INSTRUCTIONS:** You are a quality control analyst for a craft brewery experimenting with a new India Pale Ale (IPA). One key quality attribute of IPA is its bitterness, measured in International Bitterness Units (IBUs). The brewery wants to determine if the aging time (3, 4, or 5 weeks) affects the IBUs of the beer. To test this, the brewing team brews a single batch of the experimental IPA and divides it into aging tanks, with each tank randomly assigned to be aged for 3, 4, or 5 weeks. After aging, the IBUs of ten randomly selected bottles from each aging time are measured using a spectrophotometer. The data are in the file `IPA.xlsx`. With these data, I want you to:\n",

        "**Question 1.** Briefly define the objective of this experiment\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of the experiment is to determine whether the aging time (3, 4, or 5 weeks) has an effect on the bitterness of the IPA. The bitterness is measured by International Bitterness Units (IBUs). In other words, the experiment aims to see if different aging durations produce a statistically significant difference in IPA's  bitterness.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2.** Specify the outcome variable\n",
        "\n",
        "The outcome variable is the bitterness of the IPA. It is measured by quantitatively in IBUs by using spectrophotometer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 3.** Specify the independent variable. What are some possible lurking variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "The independent variable is the aging time with three levels (3, 4, or 5 weeks)\n",
        "Some of the lurking varaibles are\n",
        "      - Temperature variations during aging\n",
        "      - Contamination or microbial activity\n",
        "      - Oxygen exposure in the tanks\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 4.** Briefly explain why a completely randomized design may be appropriate for this experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Completely randomized design might be appropriate for this experiment because all bottles are randomly assigned to aging times, which helps control for other factors and ensures that differences in bitterness (IBUs) are due to aging time rather than other variables. It's simple, fair, and effective for this experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 5.** State the null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Null hypotheses:- Aging time has no effect on the bitterness of the IPA.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternative hypotheses:- Aging time does affect the bitterness of the IPA. At least one aging time has a different mean IBU than the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 6.** Perform appropriate exploratory analysis, including summary statistics **and** data visualizations. Do the results of these analyses support the null or alternative hypothesis more strongly?\n",
